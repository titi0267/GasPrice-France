Use this Api with [GasPrices](https://github.com/titi0267/GasPrices)

## Description

This project fetches the data that I need to run the [GasPrices](https://github.com/titi0267/GasPrices) app.

The project is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/dashboard), but you may want to run it in local because some Api may run out of free requests

1. Add a .env file with the following fields to the project.

   Api port listens on 8080 by default

   ```.env
    PORT=8080
   ```

2. Install the dependencies with npm

   ```bash
   npm i
   ```

## Launch

Launch the project with
`npm run start`.
